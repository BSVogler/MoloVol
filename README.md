Cavol is a free, cross-plattform, scientific software for volume and surface computations of single molecules and crystallographic unit cells.

Utility
-------
With the CaVol software we aim to combine an intuitive and easy-to-use user interface with powerful computing algorithms. We want the software to serve a broad range of scientist by being easily accessible on all common platforms.

The CaVol software, along with many of its features, is currently in early development. The software is being actively developed on Windows 10 and macOS Catalina.

Getting Started
---------------
If you have Git installed on your computer you can run

`$ git clone https://github.com/jmaglic/ballpit`

to download the repository on your local machine. To compile the code you will need a C++ compiler, such as g++. You will also need to obtain the dependecies. If all components for compilation are available, you should be able to compile the code by running the command

`$ make`

Dependencies:
- wxWidgets 3.1.4 (https://www.wxwidgets.org)
